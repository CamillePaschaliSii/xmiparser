XMIParser model factory
=======================

The way to get a ``xmiparser.interfaces.IModel`` implementation is some kind
of heavy, so this package provides a factory to do the job for you, done via an
utility.

As input, the factory accepts ``*.zargo``, ``*.zuml`` and ``*.xmi`` files,
expecting the file path.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from xmiparser.interfaces import IModelFactory
    >>> factory = getUtility(IModelFactory)

get a clue what self.generate_packages and self.generate_datatypes on
ArchetypesGenerator should be good for.

    >>> import os
    >>> model = factory(os.path.join(datadir, '01_pkg_class.zargo'))
    >>> # model
